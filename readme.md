## Text Classification Experiments on Reuters

Implementation of three classification models for the Reuters task:

1. Linear models
2. Multi Layer Perceptron
3. Convolutional Neural Network

Preprocessing, models and evaluation rely on Scikit-learn, Keras and Nltk.
Parts of the code have been adapted from examples in Keras. The tokenizer
in the preprocessing module is based on the example shown in
